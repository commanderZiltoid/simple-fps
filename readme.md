## Simple 2.5d fps example using three.js webgl library for javascript

This simple example demonstrates how to use 2d sprites for characters in a 3d environment. It calculates the rotations
and displays the correct sprite image to the player camera. There is currently no "shoot" action as this is simply to 
demonstrate the 2d sprite rotation animations, but such event may be added at a later date.

A complete explanation of what is going on is in the works and will be available shortly.
